# pingone-openapi-specs

This project contains unofficial OpenAPI v3 specifications for the PingOne Identity Platform.  Official API documentation can be found [here](https://apidocs.pingidentity.com/pingone/platform/v1/api/)

This specification was originally generated from the public [Postman collection](https://apidocs.pingidentity.com/pingone/devguide/v1/api/#download-the-pingone-postman-collections) and each operation is groomed as-and-when needed.  There is a mix of groomed operations (with defined 'operationId' attributes and full schema data models) and ungroomed operations

This spec can be taken and extended based on configured custom attributes, for example on the User object, and therefore used to generate in-house documentation and/or client SDKs
