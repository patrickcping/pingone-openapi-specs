# Contributing to the OpenAPI Specification

Thanks for looking to contribute!  This is an unofficial specification to help developers consuming the PingOne platform.  We can expect that developers can take this specification (including the Schema) and extend the data model (as is possible to do with PingOne), to create an internal reference for their use cases.

These are guidelines only and intended not to be overly restrictive.

## Issues and Pull Requests

## Common Changes

The spec was generated from a Postman collection, as such there are a number of 'generated' operationId fields and missing schema references.  There are some mislabeled operations also.  If 'grooming' some of these operations, please look at the "Groups" entity as an example
